The goal of this project is to control smart home lights (IOT lights) using hand gestures. Initially, I am starting off with a PC and a webcam but this project would be developed into an open source software to be installed on mobile devices like a Raspberry Pi with a camera.

Initial Roadmap:

Camera -> openCV -> python code -> IFTTT -> light

Software being used:
Programming language: python
ML: OpenCV
IFTTT
